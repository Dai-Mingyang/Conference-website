<p><b>TheoryFest 2022 will hold workshops during the conference week, June 20&ndash;24, 2022. We invite
groups of interested researchers to submit workshop proposals.</b></p>

<p>
The TheoryFest workshops will provide an informal forum for researchers
to discuss important research questions, directions and challenges in
the field, as well as a venue to invite new researchers to an area. They
will begin with a tutorial, and will continue with research talks or
other events highlighting recent results and new directions. We
encourage workshops that focus on connections between theoretical
computer science and other areas.

</p><p><b>Format</b>:
<ul>
<li>Workshops will typically span three days, about three hours per day.
(So, about <b>nine hours of total content</b>).</li>
<li>Each workshop should begin with a tutorial, aimed at inviting
graduate students and non-experts to the field and hopefully preparing
them to engage with the later talks.  We suggest that the tutorial take
up most or all of the first day of the workshop.</li>
<li>After the tutorial, the organizers can decide about a mix of invited
talks and/or events such as open problem sessions or social events.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Proposal Submission</h3>

Workshop and tutorial proposals should, ideally, fit within two pages.
Please include a list of names and email addresses of the organizers, a
brief description of the topic and the goals of the workshop, and the
format (what mix of tutorial, invited talks or other events) and
proposed or tentatively confirmed speakers if known. Feel free to
contact the Workshops Committee (listed below) directly with questions.

<h3> Submission Instructions</h3>

Proposals should be submitted by February 15, 2022 via email to <a
href="mailto:shuchi@cs.utexas.edu">shuchi@cs.utexas.edu</a> with the
subject line “STOC 22 Workshop Proposal”. Proposers will be notified by
February 15, 2022 whether their proposals have been accepted.
